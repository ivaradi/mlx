  <h1>MAVA Logger X User's Manual</h1>

  <h2>Overview</h2>

  <p>
  MAVA Logger X is an application that monitors the execution of a
  Malév Virtual flight, and collects data that can be sent to the MAVA
  website for further evaluation. This manual describes how to use
  this program. To be able to use the program properly, you need to
  have a working Internet connection, even if you don't fly on-line on
  VATSIM or IVAO.
  </p>

  <p>
  While monitoring your flight the program continuously checks if your
  airplane's configuration is always within the parameters prescribed
  by the airline's operating procedures. For example, you have to turn
  on or off the various lights of your aircraft according to rules,
  you cannot exceed certain weight or speed limits, and so on. Any
  deviation from the expected parameters, also know as a fault, can
  result in points subtracted from the initial 100 points (or
  percentage). The result is your <i>flight rating</i>. Some
  deviations are so serious, that they are deemed <i>NO GO</i> faults
  and result in the rejection of your flight.
  </p>

  <p>
  Besides the faults the program also monitors many other parameters,
  which are recorded in a textual <i>log</i>. This log is sent as a
  part of your PIREP (<b>PI</b>lot's <b>REP</b>ort), and will be
  analyzed, and possibly commented on by more experienced pilot's of
  Malév Virtual. This way you can perfect the way you execute your
  flights.
  </p>

  <p>
  The application breaks up your flight into
  several <i>stage</i>s. The advancement from one stage to another is
  detected automatically. These stages and the conditions under which
  they are entered are as follows:
  <ol>
    <li><b>boarding</b>: This is the initial stage when you start the
    flight.</li>
    <li><b>push-back and taxi</b>: If you release the parking brakes
    or your ground speed becomes 5 knots or greater during the
    boarding stage, your flight enters this stage.</li>
    <li><b>takeoff</b>: If you turn on the landing and/or the strobe
    lights or your ground speed exceeds 80 knots during taxi or after
    a rejected takeoff (RTO).</li>
    <li><b>climb</b>: When you retract the gears or you reach 3000
    feet altitude AGL with a positive climb rate after takeoff.</li>
    <li><b>RTO</b>: If you switch off both the landing and the
    strobe lights, and your speed is reduced below 50 knots while on
    the ground during takeoff.</li>
    <li><b>cruise</b>: When the aircraft's altitude is within 2000
    feet of the cruise altitude and you are climbing.</li>
    <li><b>descent</b>: If the altitude decreases to more than 2000
    feet below the cruise altitude during cruise.</li>
    <li><b>landing</b>: If the gears are lowered and the altitude is
    less than 2000 feet AGL during descent or go-around.</li>
    <li><b>go-around</b>: If you retract the gears during landing.</li>
    <li><b>taxi after landing</b>: When the aircraft is in the
    ground and its ground speed is below 50 knots after landing.</li>
    <li><b>parking</b>: If the parking brake is activated after taxi.</li>
    <li><b>end</b>: If the N<sub>1</sub> of the turbines becomes
    less than 0.5, or the RPM of the piston engines becomes 0 during
    parking. This is the final stage.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
  To enhance the simulation, the program can play various sound files
  during the various stages of your flight, such as the announcements
  made by the flight attendants. These files are supplied with the
  application, and they can be played automatically, or when you press
  a certain hotkey in the flight simulator. You can also organize
  pre-recorded sound files into checklists for the each aircraft
  type, and these files can also be played back one-by-one when you
  repeatedly press a key combination in the simulator. See below for
  more information on this.
  </p>

  <p>
  Malév Virtual has implemented an <i>Online ACARS System</i>, which
  displays the status of the flights in progress. The data appears on
  the front page of the MAVA website and on a map accessible from the
  inner page.
  </p>

  <p>
  Malév Virtual has also implemented an <i>Online Gate System</i>
  which maintains a database of the aircraft in the airline's fleet
  and their location. An aircraft may be parked at the Budapest
  Ferihegy Airport, in which case the number of the gate or stand it
  is located at is recorded in the database. If so, this number is
  displayed to you when starting your flight, and you are recommended
  to place your aircraft at the indicated gate or stand in the
  simulator. If your flight begins at Ferihegy and the aircraft is
  away (usually due to someone else's flight), you can select from
  which gate or stand you start your flight. The database of the
  Online Gate System can also be displayed by using the application.
  </p>

  <p>
  The program can automatically update itself. When it starts up, it
  checks if there is a newer version available. If so, it downloads
  its files and replaces the program's current files with the new
  ones. Then the program is restarted so that you can use the new
  version. Besides acquiring bug fixes, updating is also important,
  because the program can be extended with new checks or more refined
  checks, and if you are using too old a version, the PIREP reviewers
  may refuse your flight.
  </p>

  <h3>Graphical User Interface</h3>

  <p>
  The GUI of the application is made up of traditional building blocks
  (buttons, checkboxes, lists, text entry boxes, etc.) found in other
  applications as well. Many such controls have informative tooltips
  that supplement the contents of this User's Guide in helping you
  using the application. Many controls are also accessible by pressing
  the <b>Alt</b> plus the underlined letter in the control's label.
  </p>

  <p>
  The most often used part of the program is the main window, to be
  described in detail below. When you minimize or close the window, it
  disappears by default, but the program continues to run. You can
  redisplay the window by clicking on the tray icon of the program,
  which looks like the one on the picture below.
  </p>

  <p>
  If you click on the tray icon when the program's window is hidden,
  the window will be displayed. If you hover the mouse pointer over
  the icon, the flight stage and the current rating will be
  displayed. The tray icon has a right-button menu as well with the
  following items: 
  <ul>
    <li><b>Show main window</b>: displays or hides the main window.</li>
    <li><b>Show monitor window</b>: displays or hides the monitor
    window (see below).</li>
    <li><b>Quit</b>: quit the application. A confirmation window will
    be displayed.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
  You can also quit the application by selecting the <b>File/Quit</b>
  menu item, or by pressing <b>Ctrl+Q</b>.
  </p>

  <p>
  If you start the application, when it is already running, the main
  window of the already running instance will be displayed instead of
  starting a new instance of the program.
  </p>
  
  <h2>The Main Window</h2>

  <p>
  The figure below depicts the main window of the application. The top
  of it contains the usual menu bar, which will be describe in more
  detail later.
  </p>

  <p>
  The content area consists of several tabs the use of which is
  described below.
  </p>

  <p>
  The bottom of the window is a status bar. Its left end contains the
  icon indicating the status of the connection to the simulator. Since
  the application continuously monitors the parameters of your
  aircraft, it needs to communicate with the simulator. The icon's
  colour indicates the health of this communication channel.
  </p>
 
  <p>
  If it is grey, the program is not connected. This is normal before
  and after the flight. If it is green, the connection is alive and
  working properly. If it is red, the connection is broken. In this
  case a dialog window is displayed. The most likely cause for such a
  disruption is the crash of the simulator. If this is the case,
  restart the simulator and try to restore the flight to a state as
  close to the one before the crash as possible. Then click
  the <b>Reconnect</b> button, and the program will try to
  re-establish the connection to the simulator. It preserves all data
  of your flight, so you can continue where you left off easily.
  </p>

  <p>
  If the reason for the failure of the connection is something else,
  do whatever is needed to be done to restore it. Of course, it is
  possible that the logger application itself fails, in which case
  you, unfortunately, have to restart the flight. Do not forget to
  notify the author if this happens.
  </p>

  <p>
  If you click the <b>Cancel</b> button in the reconnection dialog,
  the logger will be reset as if it were stopped and restarted.
  </p>

  <p>
  To the right of the connection status icon, you can see the current
  stage of the flight, if the monitoring has begun. Otherwise it is a
  single dash. It is followed by the simulator time, if the program is
  already connected to the simulator. Then comes the current flight
  rating. 
  </p>

  <p>
  The right if the status bar is normally empty, but if there is some
  potentially long operation going on (typically communicating with
  the MAVA servers), information about the operation is displayed
  here. This is accompanied by the cursor becoming that of signaling
  a busy state and most parts of the main window becoming
  unresponsive.
  </p>

  <h3>The Flight Tab</h3>
  
  <p>
  The flight tab is the most import tab. It consists of a sequence of
  pages similar to wizards found in many programs. The first several of
  these pages guide you through the various steps of the preparations
  for your flight, while the last pages allow you to enter some
  information about your flight necessary for its evaluation and to
  send the PIREP (Pilot's Report) assembled by the program to the MAVA
  website.
  </p>

  <p>
  Each page has a title at the top indicating the purpose of the
  page. There is a short text below this, which describes what the
  page contains and/or what is expected from you to do with the page.
  Below the text you can find the main information and possibly data
  entry areas for the page. Finally, you can find the button row at
  the bottom.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Most of the pages contain two buttons: <b>Next</b> and
  <b>Previous</b>. These help in navigating between the pages. In most
  cases you can go back to previously visited pages by using
  the <b>Previous</b> button, although you cannot edit the contents of
  those pages once finalized by moving to the next page using
  the <b>Next</b> button. There are a few exceptions though, as
  detailed below.
  </p>

  <h4>The <i>Login</i> Page</h4>

  <p>
  Each flight starts with the Login page where you can enter the your
  pilot's ID and password for the MAVA website. Both data are given
  to you when joining Malév Virtual. The pilot's ID usually starts
  with the letter <q>P</q> followed by three digits. 
  </p>

  <p>
  If you check <b>Remember password</b>, the password will be saved by
  the program, so you don't have to enter it all the time. Note,
  however, that the password is saved plainly into a configuration
  file, so you this possibility only if your home directory can be
  accessed only by people you trust. The pilot's ID is saved anyway.
  </p>

  <p>
  If you are about to perform the entrance flight, check
  <b>Entrance exam</b>. In this case you don't have to (and cannot)
  enter the password, as that is not needed for the entrance exam.
  </p>

  <p>
  The login to the MAVA server, and proceed to the next page, press
  the <b>Login</b> button.
  </p>
  
  <h4>The <i>Flight selection</i> Page</h4>

  <p>
  This page displays the list of the flight you have booked previously
  on the MAVA website. You can also upload a flight from a file by
  pressing the <b>Load flight from file</b> button. This displays a
  file selection dialog where you select the flight file (usually with
  a suffix of <code>.vaflight</code>). Since you cannot
  send the PIREP for such flights, this is mostly useful during the
  entrance exam.
  </p>

  <p>
  Select a flight from the list, and press <b>Next</b> button to
  proceed with that flight.
  </p>

  <h4>The <i>LHBP gate selection</i> Page</h4>
  
  <p>
  This page is displayed after the flight selection page only if your
  flight starts at the Budapest Ferihegy Airport and the number of the
  gate or stand at which your aircraft is located cannot be
  determined.
  </p>

  <p>
  Select a number from the list presented, and press <b>Next</b>.
  </p>

  <h4>The <i>Connect to the simulator</i> Page</h4>

  <p>
  This page displays some important information about your flight,
  such as the type and tail number of the aircraft to use, the
  departure airport and possibly the gate.
  </p>

  <p>
  Select the aircraft indicated and park it at the departure airport,
  then press <b>Connect</b> to establish the connection with the
  simulator. If the connection cannot be established, a dialog will be
  displayed about it, and you can <b>Try again</b> the connection
  or <b>Cancel</b> to go back to the login page.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Note, that after a successful connection, the monitoring of your
  flight does not begin immediately, but some data can be queried by
  the logger at this stage.
  </p>

  <h4>The <i>Payload</i> Page</h4>

  <p>
  This page displays the components of the flight's payload and the
  calculated Zero-Fuel Weight (ZFW). You can enter here the cargo
  weight you determined for your flight. You can also press the <b>ZFW
  from FS</b> button, which queries the ZFW from the simulator and
  displays the retrieved value. If the ZFW calculated from the payload
  data differs too much from the queried one, the calculated value is
  displayed in red. This the right time to set up the payload in the
  simulator. If you forget about it, it will be a NO GO fault.
  </p>

  <p>
  If you have finished with this page, press the <b>Next</b>
  button. At this point, the <i>Help</i> tab becomes available, which
  you can use if you have failed to set up the correct payload in the
  simulator. See a more detailed description of it below.
  </p>

  <h4>The <i>Time</i> Page</h4>

  <p>
  This page displays the departure and arrival times of your
  flight in UTC. Press the <b>Time from FS</b> button to query the
  current UTC time of the simulator. To be able to simulate the real
  lighting circumstances of the flight, the simulator's time should mach
  the time of the flight according to the schedule. Therefore you are
  expected to set the simulator's time properly. It is recommended to
  set it to about 15 minutes before the departure at this stage so
  that you have enough time to set up your flight.
  </p>

  <p>
  When you have set the time of the simulator properly, press
  the <b>Next</b> button.
  </p>

  <h4>The <i>Fuel</i> Page</h4>

  <p>
  This page contains a graphical representation of the fuel tanks of
  your aircraft. The yellowish colour represents the current level of
  the fuel in the tank, and turquoise slider is the expected level,
  which is also displayed numerically (in kilograms) below each graph. 
  </p>

  <p>
  You can enter the requested amount of fuel numerically, or you can
  set it by the turquoise sliders, though this method less accurate. The
  lever can be moved by clicking in the fuel tank's representation,
  and you can drag it if you keep the button pressed. If your mouse
  has a wheel, that can also be used to modify the expected level. To
  use the wheel, keep the mouse pointer within the fuel tank's
  graphic. Each click of the wheel increment or decrements the amount
  by 10 kilograms. If you hold down the <b>Shift</b> key, the
  increment will be 100, if you hold down the <b>Ctrl</b> key, the
  increment will be 1.
  </p>

  <p>
  When all tanks have the correct amount of fuel set, press
  the <b>Next</b> button. This causes the pumping of the fuel to
  start. The progress is represented by the yellowish fuel bars
  growing or shrinking (fuel may be pumped out of a tank as
  well). This is a relatively quick process and should finish within a
  few seconds. 
  </p>

  <h4>The <i>Route</i> Page</h4>
  
  <p>
  This page displays the cruise level and the flight plan route. The
  cruise level starts out at FL240, but the route comes from the
  booked flight. Set the cruise level to the one you have calculated
  with, and modify the flight plan if needed. For example, if you will
  enter some airspace that will require you to change the flight
  level, you should add that here.
  </p>

  <p>
  When satisfied with the information on the page, press
  the <b>Next</b> button to advance. Note, that these data can be
  edited later as well if you come back to this page.
  </p>

  <h4>The <i>Briefing</i> Pages</h4>
  
  <p>
  These pages display the NOTAMs and the METAR for the departure and
  the arrival airports. You can edit the METAR if your network
  provides a different weather, or you do not fly with real
  weather. The METAR of the arrival airport will be updated when
  entering the landing stage, unless you have edited it before. The
  METARs can be edited during the whole duration of the flight. If you
  do so, please, comment it in the <i>Comments</i> sections of
  the <i>Flight info</i> tab.
  </p>

  <p>
  On the second briefing page (that of the arrival airport), confirm
  that you have read the briefing and are ready to start the flight by
  clicking the button. This begins the monitoring of your flight with
  the boarding stage.
  </p>
  
  <h4>The <i>Takeoff</i> Page</h4>

  <p>
  On this page you have to enter the name of the departure runway, the
  name of the Standard Instrument Departure procedure you follow after
  takeoff and the takeoff V-speeds. While you can edit these data
  anytime, it is recommended to do so before takeoff.
  <p>

  <p>
  You can proceed to the next page after takeoff, and if all data has
  been entered, by pressing the <b>Next</b> button.
  </p>

  <h4>The <i>Landing</i> Page</h4>

  <p>
  On this page you have to enter the name of the STAR and/or transition followed
  (if you get vectors from ATC, enter <q>VECTORS</q> here), the
  approach type (e.g. <q>ILS</q>, <q>VOR</q>, <q>VISUAL</q>, etc.),
  the name of the landing runway, and the landing reference speed,
  V<sub>ref</sub>. You can enter this data during the flight, or after
  you have landed at your discretion.
  </p>

  <p>
  When you have entered all data, press the <b>Next</b> button. It is
  active only, if the flight has ended.
  </p>

  <h4>The <i>Finish</i> Page</h4>

  <p>
  This is the final page of the flight wizard. It contains a summary
  of your flight: the rating, the flight and block times, the distance
  flown and the amount of fuel burnt.
  </p>

  <p>
  You also have to provide a few pieces of information. You have to
  select the type of the flight from the list provided (scheduled,
  old-timer, VIP, charter) and whether it was an online flight or
  not. If you arrive at the Budapest Ferihegy Airport, and are using
  the Online Gate System, you also need to specify the number of the
  gate or stand you have parked you aircraft at.
  </p>

  <p>
  With all data entered, you may want it review your flight, then save
  or send the PIREP created from it. These can be accomplished by
  pressing one of the buttons at the bottom. A saved PIREP can be
  loaded later and sent, if the sending fails for some reason. When a
  PIREP is sent, it becomes available for review by the designated
  PIREP reviewers of Malév Virtual.
  </p>

  <h3>The Flight info Tab</h3>

  <p>
  This tab allows one to enter some additional information about the 
  flight, if necessary.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  The <i>Comments</i> text area should contain any general information
  that you would like the PIREP reviewer to know about. For example,
  why you changed the METAR, why you lowered the gears accidentally
  (i.e. pressed the wrong key on the keyboard), etc.
  </p>

  <p>
  The <i>Flight defects</i> text area should contain information about
  any problems you encountered with the plane during the flight. For
  example an engine stopped and why (if known), that flaps could not
  be extended or retracted, etc.
  </p>

  <p>
  In the <i>Delay codes</i> area you can mark one or more reasons why
  the flight was delayed, if it was. The options are self-explanatory.
  </p>

  <h3>The Help Tab</h3>

  <p>
  This tab provides some help for calculating and setting the payload
  weight of the aircraft. It can be used once the <i>Payload</i>
  (i.e. the cargo weight) is finalized. To use this tab, check
  the <b>Using help</b> checkbox. It causes the page to become
  sensitive and filled with data. Note, that the fact of using the
  help is logged, so the PIREP reviewers will know about it.
  </p>

  <p>
  The most important information is after the <i>Payload:</i> label,
  which is the payload weight of the aircraft. This value should be
  set in the simulator as the airplane's payload weight. By pressing
  the <b>Simulator data</b> button, the data on the right coming from
  the simulator can be queried and displayed. If the data is out of
  the tolerances, it is displayed in red, otherwise in green.
  </p>

  <p>
  The gross weight is also displayed with some maximum weights of the
  aircraft, so it can be checked or estimated if you will remain within
  those maximums during the flight.
  </p>
  
  <h3>The Log Tab</h3>

  <p>
  This is the main log of your flight that will be analyzed by the
  PIREP reviewers. Its contents is generated automatically by the
  program, and most lines are prefixed by the simulator times the
  information in the given line belongs to.
  </p>

  <p>
  While the log's contents is mainly useful for PIREP reviewers, it
  can come handy when things start to happen very fast, and you have
  no time check each fault message passing by (if you have enabled
  such messages at all). Later, when things calm down, you can check
  the log to see what happened exactly, so that you know why so many
  fault points have been awarded. For example, you may even decide to
  abort the flight, if you think some of the faults are to
  embarrassing :)
  </p>

  <h3>The Gates Tab</h3>

  <p>
  This tab displays information retrieved from the MAVA Online Gate
  System. If the program needs to retrieve data, this tab's contents
  are refreshed automatically, but you can refresh them anytime using
  the <b>Refresh data</b> button.
  </p>

  <p>
  The left side of the tab contains the fleet information. The tail
  number of each aircraft is listed with the plane's status, as known
  by the Online Gate System. The two major statuses are <i>LHBP-nn</i>
  and <i>AWAY</i>. The former indicates that the aircraft is parked at
  the Budapest Ferihegy Airport at gate or stand <i>nn</i>, while the
  latter one denotes that the airplane is parked at another
  airport. Another possible status is <i>PARKED</i>, which means that
  the airplane is parked somewhere at the Ferihegy Airport, but we
  (or at least the Gate System) don't know where. It may happen that
  several aircraft are parked at the same gate or stand at
  Ferihegy. In this case the tail numbers and the statuses of those
  airplanes are displayed in red.
  </p>

  <p>
  The right side contains the list of the numbers of the gates and
  parking positions. A number is black if no aircraft is positioned at
  the corresponding gate or stand, and it is orange, if the location
  is occupied.
  </p>

  <h3>The Debug log</h3>

  <p>
  This tab is not visible by default, but can be displayed by
  selecting <b>View/Show debug log</b> or by
  pressing <b>Ctrl+D</b>. It is another kind of log, which is mainly
  useful for debugging. If you experience some problem with the
  program, please, include the contents of this log with your bug
  report. It can help a low with finding a solution to the problem.
  </p>

  <h2>Loading PIREPs</h2>

  <p>
  Saved PIREPs can be loaded and sent by the program loader. This can
  become necessary, for example, if you cannot send a PIREP due to
  some network problem right after your flight.
  </p>

  <p>
  To load a PIREP select the <b>File/Load PIREP...</b> menu option or
  press the <b>Ctrl+L</b> key. A file selection dialog appears, from
  which you can select the PIREP to load. If you select a valid PIREP
  file, it will be loaded and a new window will be displayed with the
  most important data of your flight. By clicking <b>Send
  PIREP...</b>, the PIREP will be sent (or at least an attempt will be
  made at sending it). A dialog window will be displayed about the
  results of the attempt.
  </p>

  <h2>Editing checklists</h2>

  <p>
  The checklists are lists of audio files. When checklist playback is
  enabled (see the description of the Preferences window below), and
  there is a checklist for the type of the aircraft used for the
  flight, the files constituting the checklist can be played
  one-by-one by pressing the checklist hotkey repeatedly.
  </p>

  <p>
  The checklist editor dialog box allows for editing the checklist. It
  can be displayed by selecting <b>Tools/Checklist Editor...</b> or
  pressing <b>Ctrl+C</b>. The top of the window contains an aircraft
  type selector.
  </p>

  <p>
  The files making up the checklist for the currently  selected flight
  are displayed on the right. You can move a file up or down by
  dragging it with the mouse. You can also select one or more files
  from the list. Then you can remove them with the <b>Remove</b>
  button, or move them up or down by pressing <b>Move up</b>
  and <b>Move down</b>. 
  </p>

  <p>
  To add new files to the checklist, select them in the file selector
  on the left, and press <b>Add to checklist</b>. The file(s) will be
  appended to the end of the checklist.
  </p>

  <p>
  Note, that any changes you make are effective only if you press
  the <b>OK</b> button when having finished the modifications. If the
  flight has already started, no changes made to the corresponding
  checklist have any effect during the flight (i.e. you will still use
  the old checklist, or no checklist if there was none).
  </p>
  
  <h2>The Preferences Window</h2>

  </p>
  The Preferences window can be displayed by
  selecting <b>Tools/Preferences</b> or by
  pressing <b>Ctrl+P</b>. Here you can set options that you usually
  don't have to change for every flight. This window also consists of
  tabs grouping the options logically.
  </p>
  
  <h3>The <i>General</i> Tab</h3>
  
  <p>
  These are some general settings for various parts of the
  program. The <i>GUI</i> frame contains options regarding the
  behaviour of the graphical user interface. The <i>Language</i> combo
  box can be used to selected what language the program should
  use. Currently English and Hungarian are supported. The value
  of <i>system default</i> means that the operating system's default
  language is used if it is one of the supported ones or English
  otherwise. Note, that the program must be restarted for the change
  to take effect if you modify this setting. If the <b>Hide main window
  when minimized</b> checkbox is checked, and you minimize the window
  it will actually disappear completely (i.e. not appear among the
  other minimized windows). You can make it appear by using the tray
  icon. 
  </p>

  <h3>The <i>Messages</i> Tab</h3>
 
  <p>
  The program can display messages about certain events in the
  simulator and/or it can play a warning sound when those events
  occur. The tab allows configuring this.
  <p>

  <p>
  The categories of the message are listed on the left. These are the
  following:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Logger Error Messages</b>: error messages about the
    internal working of the logger.</li>
    <li><b>Information Messages</b>: informational messages about,
    e.g., the flight stage, the end of an audio checklist, etc.</li>
    <li><b>Fault Messages</b>: messages about the non-NO GO faults the program detects.</li>
    <li><b>NO-GO Fault Messages</b>: messages about the NO GO faults the program detects</li>
    <li><b>Gate System Messages</b>: messages related to the Online
    Gate System. For example, when you have landed at Ferihegy, it can display
    the list of the available gates so that you can choose where to
    park, if there is no ATC available.</li>
    <li><b>Environment Messages</b>: other messages, e.g. the welcome
    message when the flight has ended.</li>
    <li><b>Help Messages</b>: help messages, e.g. warning about
    entering the V-speeds into the Takeoff page before takeoff.</li>
    <li><b>Visibility Messages</b>: messages about the visibility
    during descent and landing.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  There are two checkboxes associated with each messages category. If the
  left one (<i>Displayed in FS</i>) is checked, the messages of the
  category will be displayed in the simulator. If the right one
  (<i>Sound alert</i>) is checked, and a message of the given category
  is about to be displayed, a warning sound will be played. It is
  mainly intended to accompany the text messages, but the two options
  can be controlled separately, so you can select the sound alert, but
  not the displaying of the messages. This may be useful if you don't
  want these messages to clutter up the windscreen of your aircraft,
  but still get some notification that some problem occurred.

  <h3>The <i>Sounds</i> Tab</h3>
  
  <p>
  This tab controls how the sounds are played by the application.
  </p>

  <p>
  The top part is for the background sounds. These are pre-recorded
  sound files that are played when certain conditions hold during the
  flight. Typical examples are the various announcements the flight
  attendants make during the flight. The <b>Enable background
  sounds</b> checkbox controls whether such sounds are enabled at
  all. If the <b>Pilot controls sounds</b> checkbox is enabled, the
  pilot should start the playback of these sound files by pressing a
  hotkey in the simulator. Note, that you should still be in the right
  flight stage (and sometimes fulfill other conditions) to be able to
  play the sound files. Also, one file can be played only once. If you
  enable this option, the hotkey to press in the simulator can be
  selected below. You can choose one of the alphanumeric keys (0-9,
  A-Z) optionally combined with one or both of the <i>Ctrl</i>
  and <i>Shift</i> modifiers. If this checkbox is not checked, the
  sound files will be played automatically.
  </p>

  <p>
  If the <b>Enable speedbrake sound at touchdown</b> checkbox is
  checked, you will here a distinctive sound when the spoilers deploy
  automatically after touchdown.
  </p>

  <p>
  The lower part, named <i>Checklist</i> contains some settings
  related to the audio checklists belonging to the aircraft. They are
  available only if the <b>Enable aircraft-specific checklist></b>
  checkbox is selected. In this case another hotkey should be
  specified. If you press this hotkey, the next file from the
  checklist will be played. 
  </p>

  <h3>The <i>Advanced</i> Tab</h3>

  <p>
  This tab contains some settings that you normally should not
  change. Currently, these settings are related to the automatic
  update. If the <b>Update the program automatically</b> checkbox is
  not checked, the automatic update at program start-up will be
  omitted. The <i>Update URL</i> text entry field contains the URL
  from which to download the updates. Occasionally the developers of
  the application may tell you to change this something else, e.g. to
  test some development version. Or it may need to be changed due to
  organizational reasons, such as moving to a new server, etc.
  </p>

  <h2>The Monitor Window</h2>

  <p>
  The monitor window can be used when debugging the program. You can
  display it by selecting <b>View/Show monitor window</b> or by
  pressing <b>Ctrl+M</b>. It displays the various parameters from the
  aircraft as read from the flight simulator. During flight, it is
  updated once per second. If something is not detected properly by
  the logger, this window can be used to determine if the problem is
  in interpreting and translating the data read from the simulator, or
  when the translated data is being evaluated by other parts of the
  program.

  <h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></h2>

  <p>
  MAVA Logger X is an application that monitors the execution of a
  Malév Virtual flight, and collects data that can be sent to
  the <a href="http://virtualairlines.hu">MAVA website</a> for further
  evaluation. This manual describes how to use this program. To be
  able to use all features of the program, you need to have a working
  Internet connection, even if you don't fly on-line on VATSIM or
  IVAO. However, it is possible to perform a flight completely offline
  as well.
  </p>

  <p><a name="flightRating"/>
  While monitoring your flight, the program continuously checks if your
  airplane's configuration is always within the parameters prescribed
  by the airline's operating procedures. For example, you have to turn
  on or off the various lights of your aircraft according to rules,
  you cannot exceed certain weight or speed limits, and so on. Any
  deviation from the expected parameters, also known as a fault, can
  result in points subtracted from the initial 100 points (or
  percentage). The result is your <i>flight rating</i>. Some
  deviations are so serious, that they are deemed <i>NO GO</i> faults
  and result in the rejection of your flight.
  </p>

  <p>
  Besides the faults the program also monitors many other parameters,
  which are recorded in a textual <a href="#logTab"><i>log</i></a>.
  This log is sent as a part of your PIREP
  (<b>PI</b>lot's <b>REP</b>ort), and will be   analyzed, and possibly
  commented on by more experienced pilots of  Malév Virtual. This way
  you can perfect the way you execute your flights.
  </p>

  <p><a name="flightStages"/>
  The application breaks up your flight into
  several <i>stage</i>s. The advancement from one stage to another is
  detected automatically. These stages and the conditions under which
  they are entered are as follows:
  <ol>
    <li><b>boarding</b>: This is the initial stage when you start the
    flight.</li>
    <li><b>push-back and taxi</b>: If you release the parking brakes
    or your ground speed becomes 5 knots or greater during the
    boarding stage, your flight enters this stage.</li>
    <li><b>takeoff</b>: If you turn on the strobe lights
    during taxi or after a rejected takeoff (RTO). If your plane has
    not strobe lights, the program will track your status after
    exceeding 50 knots during the <i>taxi</i> stage, and if you lift
    off within less than 30 seconds, it will be considered a takeoff.</li>
    <li><b>climb</b>: When you retract the gears or you reach 3000
    feet altitude AGL with a positive climb rate after takeoff.</li>
    <li><b>RTO</b>: If you switch off both the landing and the
    strobe lights, and your speed is reduced below 50 knots while on
    the ground during takeoff.</li>
    <li><b>cruise</b>: When the aircraft's altitude is within 2000
    feet of the cruise altitude and you are climbing.</li>
    <li><b>descent</b>: If the altitude decreases to more than 2000
    feet below the cruise altitude during cruise.</li>
    <li><b>landing</b>: If the gears are lowered and the altitude is
    less than 2000 feet AGL during descent or go-around.</li>
    <li><b>go-around</b>: If you retract the gears during landing.</li>
    <li><b>taxi after landing</b>: When the aircraft is in the
    ground and its ground speed is below 50 knots after landing.</li>
    <li><b>end</b>: If the N<sub>1</sub> of the turbines becomes
    less than 0.5, or the RPM of the piston engines becomes 0 during
    parking. This is the final stage.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
  To enhance the simulation, the program can play various
  <a href="#prefsSounds">sound</a> files
  during the various stages of your flight, such as the announcements
  made by the flight attendants. These files are supplied with the
  application, and they can be played automatically, or when you press
  a certain hotkey in the flight simulator. You can also organize
  pre-recorded sound files
  into <a href="#checklistEditor">checklists</a> for the each aircraft
  type, and these files can also be played back one-by-one when you
  repeatedly press a key combination in the simulator. See
  <a href="#prefsSounds">below</a> for more information on this.
  </p>

  <p><a name="onlineACARSSystem"/>
  Malév Virtual have implemented an <i>Online ACARS System</i>, which
  displays the status of the flights in progress. The data appears on
  the front page of the <a href="http://virtualairlines.hu">MAVA
  website</a> and also on a
  <a href="http://virtualairlines.hu/acars2/show.html">map</a>.
  </p>

  <p><a name="onlineGateSystem"/>
  Malév Virtual have also implemented an <i>Online Gate System</i>
  which maintains a database of the aircraft in the airline's fleet
  and their location. An aircraft may be parked at the Budapest
  Ferihegy Airport, in which case the number of the gate or stand it
  is located at is recorded in the database. If so, this number is
  <a href="#connectPage">displayed</a> to you when starting your
  flight from Ferihegy, and you are recommended to place your aircraft
  at the indicated gate or stand in the simulator. If your flight
  begins at Ferihegy and the aircraft is away (usually due to someone
  else's flight), you can <a href="#gateSelectionPage">select</a>
  from which gate or stand you start your flight. The database of the
  Online Gate System can also be <a href="#gatesTab">displayed</a>
  by using the application.
  </p>

  <p>
  These online systems can only be used when flying online.
  </p>

  <p>
  The program can automatically update itself. When it starts up, it
  checks if there is a newer version available. If so, it downloads
  its files and replaces the program's current files with the new
  ones. Then the program is restarted so that you can use the new
  version. Besides acquiring bug fixes, updating is also important,
  because the program can be extended with new checks or more refined
  checks, and if you are using too old a version, the PIREP reviewers
  may refuse your flight.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="gui">Graphical User Interface</a></h3>

  <p>
  The GUI of the application is made up of traditional building blocks
  (buttons, checkboxes, lists, text entry boxes, etc.) found in other
  applications as well. Many such controls have informative tooltips
  that supplement the contents of this User's Guide in helping you
  using the application. Many controls are also accessible by pressing
  the <b>Alt</b> plus the underlined letter in the control's label.
  </p>

  <p>
  The most often used part of the program is the main window, to be
  described in detail below. When you minimize or close the window, it
  disappears by default, but the program continues to run. You can
  redisplay the window by clicking on the tray icon of the program,
  which looks like the one on the picture below.
  </p>

  <div align="center">
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <img src="statusIcon1.png" alt="The status icon" hspace="20"/>
        </td>
        <td>
          <img src="statusIcon2.png" alt="The status icon menu" hspace="20"/>
        </td>
    </table>
  </div>

  <p>
  If you click on the tray icon when the program's window is hidden,
  the window will be displayed. If you hover the mouse pointer over
  the icon, the flight stage and the current rating will be
  displayed. The tray icon has a right-button menu as well with the
  following items:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Show main window</b>: displays or hides the main window.</li>
    <li><b>Show monitor window</b>: displays or hides the
      <a href="#monitorWindow">monitor window</a>.</li>
    <li><b>Quit</b>: quit the application. A confirmation window will
    be displayed.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
  You can also quit the application by selecting the <b>File/Quit</b>
  menu item, or by pressing <b>Ctrl+Q</b>.
  </p>

  <p>
  If you start the application, when it is already running, the main
  window of the already running instance will be displayed instead of
  starting a new instance of the program.
  </p>

  <h2><a name="mainWindow">The Main Window</a></h2>

  <p>
  The figure below depicts the main window of the application. The top
  of it contains the usual menu bar, which will be described in more
  detail later. The content area consists of several tabs the use of
  which is described below.
  </p>

  <a name="mainWindowShot"/>
  <div align="center"><img src="mainWindow.png" alt="The main window"/></div>

  <p>
  The bottom of the window is a status bar. Its left side contains the
  icon indicating the status of the connection to the simulator. Since
  the application continuously monitors the parameters of your
  aircraft, it needs to communicate with the simulator. The icon's
  colour indicates the health of this communication channel.
  </p>

  <p>
  If it is grey, the program is not connected. This is normal before
  and after the flight. If it is green, the connection is alive and
  working properly. If it is red, the connection is broken. In this
  case a dialog window is displayed. The most likely cause for such a
  disruption is the crash of the simulator. If this is the case,
  restart the simulator and try to restore the flight to a state as
  close to the one before the crash as possible. Then click
  the <b>Reconnect</b> button, and the program will try to
  re-establish the connection to the simulator. It preserves all data
  of your flight, so you can continue where you left off easily.
  </p>

  <p>
  If the reason for the failure of the connection is something else,
  do whatever is needed to be done to restore it. Of course, it is
  possible that the logger application itself fails, in which case
  you, unfortunately, have to restart the flight. Do not forget to
  notify the author if this happens. In this case, try to copy and
  save the <a href="#debugLog">debug log</a> and send it with your bug
  report.
  </p>

  <p>
  If you click the <b>Cancel</b> button in the reconnection dialog,
  the logger will be reset as if it were stopped and restarted.
  </p>

  <p>
  To the right of the connection status icon, you can see the current
  <a href="#flightStages">stage</a> of the flight, if the monitoring
  has begun. Otherwise it is a single dash. It is followed by the
  simulator time, if the program is already connected to the
  simulator. Then comes the current <a href="#flightRating">flight rating</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
  The right of the status bar is normally empty, but if there is some
  potentially long operation going on (typically communicating with
  the MAVA servers), information about the operation is displayed
  here. This is accompanied by the cursor becoming that of signaling
  a busy state and most parts of the main window becoming
  unresponsive.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="tabFlight">The Flight Tab</a></h3>

  <p>
  The flight tab is the most important tab. It consists of a sequence of
  pages similar to wizards found in many programs. The first several of
  these pages guide you through the various steps of the preparations
  for your flight, while the last pages allow you to enter some
  information about your flight necessary for its evaluation and to
  send the PIREP (Pilot's Report) assembled by the program to the MAVA
  server.
  </p>

  <p>
  Each page has a title at the top indicating the purpose of the
  page. There is a short text below this, which describes what the
  page contains and/or what is expected from you to do with the page.
  Below the text you can find the main information and possibly data
  entry areas for the page. Finally, you can find the button row at
  the bottom.
  </p>

  <p>
  Most of the pages contain two buttons: <b>Next</b> and
  <b>Previous</b>. These help in navigating between the pages. In most
  cases you can go back to previously visited pages by using
  the <b>Previous</b> button, although you cannot edit the contents of
  some of the pages once finalized by moving to the next page using
  the <b>Next</b> button. There are a few exceptions though, as
  detailed below.
  </p>

  <p>
  Many of the pages also contain a <b>Cancel flight</b>
  button. Clicking this button will allow you to cancel the flight and
  go back to the <a href="#flightSelectionPage">flight selection</a>
  if you have logged in to the MAVA server, or to the login page, after
  a confirmation of your intent.
  </p>

  <h4><a name="loginPage">The <i>Login</i> Page</a></h4>

  <p>
  The program starts with the Login page (see the
  <a href="#mainWindowShot">picture</a> above) where you can enter the
  your pilot's ID and password for the MAVA website. Both data are
  given to you when joining Malév Virtual. The pilot's ID usually
  starts with the letter <q>P</q> followed by three digits.
  </p>

  <p>
  If you check <b>Remember password</b>, the password will be saved by
  the program, so you don't have to enter it all the time. Note,
  however, that the password is saved in a readable form into a
  configuration file, so use this possibility only if your home
  directory can be accessed only by people you trust. The pilot's ID
  is saved anyway.
  </p>

  <p>
  If you are about to perform the entrance flight, check
  <b>Entrance exam</b>. In this case you don't have to (and cannot)
  enter the password, as that is not needed for the entrance exam.
  </p>

  <p>
  The login to the MAVA server, and proceed to the next page, press
  the <b>Login</b> button.
  </p>

  <p>
  If you would like to fly without an Internet connection, use
  the <b>Fly offline</b> button. This immediately takes you to the
  next page, without trying to log in to the MAVA server.
  </p>

  <h4><a name="flightSelectionPage">The <i>Flight selection</i> Page</a></h4>

  <img src="flightSelection.png" alt="The Flight selection page"/>

  <p>
  This page displays the list of the flight you have booked previously
  on the MAVA website, if you have <a href="#loginPage">logged in</a>
  properly. If you chose to fly offline, the list is empty.
  </p>

  <p>
  If you have selected a flight, you can also save it by using
  the <b>Save flight</b> button. This is useful when planning to fly
  offline at some later time. When preparing for that flight, you can
  properly log in to the MAVA server, and acquire the list of your
  booked flights. Then you can save the flight you wish to perform
  later offline, on which occasion, you can load the saved flight.
  </p>

  <p>
  You may need to refresh the list of flights. For example, you notice
  that you have forgotten to book the flight you want to perform. Then
  you can book the flight on the MAVA website, and press
  the <b>Refresh flights</b> button to update the list.
  </p>

  <p>
  You can also load a flight from a file by  pressing the <b>Load
  flight from file</b> button. This displays a file selection dialog
  where you select the flight file (usually with a suffix
  of <code>.vaflight</code>). This is mostly useful when flying
  offline, or during the entrance exam.
  </p>

  <p>
  Select a flight from the list, and press the <b>Next</b> button to
  proceed with that flight.
  </p>

  <h4><a name="gateSelectionPage">The <i>LHBP gate selection</i> Page</a></h4>

  <img src="gateSelection.png" alt="The LHBP gate selection page"/>

  <p>
  This page is displayed after the flight selection page only if your
  flight starts at the Budapest Ferihegy Airport and the number of the
  gate or stand at which your aircraft is located cannot be
  determined.
  </p>

  <p>
  Select a number from the list presented, and press <b>Next</b>.
  </p>

  <h4><a name="connectPage">The <i>Connect to the simulator</i> Page</a></h4>

  <img src="connect.png" alt="The Connect to the simulator page"/>

  <p>
  This page displays some important information about your flight,
  such as the type and tail number of the aircraft to use, the
  departure airport and possibly the gate.
  </p>

  <p>
  Select the aircraft indicated and park it at the departure airport
  in the simulator,
  then press <b>Connect</b> to establish the connection with the
  simulator. If the connection cannot be established, a dialog will be
  displayed about it, and you can <b>Try again</b> the connection
  or <b>Cancel</b> to go back to the flight selection or to the login page.
  </p>

  <p>
  Note, that after a successful connection, the monitoring of your
  flight does not begin immediately, but some data can be queried by
  the logger at this stage.
  </p>

  <h4><a name="payloadPage">The <i>Payload</i> Page</a></h4>

  <img src="payload.png" alt="The Payload page"/><!-- TODO: update -->

  <p>
  This page displays the components of the flight's payload and the
  calculated Zero-Fuel Weight (ZFW). You can modify all input data,
  but generally it is needed to enter the cargo weight you determined
  for the flight, if it is different from 0. You can also press the <b>ZFW
  from FS</b> button, which queries the ZFW from the simulator and
  displays the retrieved value. If the ZFW calculated from the payload
  data differs too much from the queried one, the calculated value is
  displayed in red. This the right time to set up the payload in the
  simulator. If you forget about it, it will be a NO GO fault.
  </p>

  <p>
  If you have finished with this page, press the <b>Next</b>
  button. At this point, the <a href="#helpTab"><i>Help</i> tab</a>
  becomes available, which you can use if you have failed to set up
  the correct payload in the simulator. See a more detailed
  description of it <a href="#helpTab">below</a>.
  </p>

  <h4><a name="timePage">The <i>Time</i> Page</a></h4>

  <img src="time.png" alt="The Time page"/>

  <p>
  This page displays the departure and arrival times of your
  flight in UTC. Press the <b>Time from FS</b> button to query the
  current UTC time of the simulator. To be able to simulate the real
  lighting circumstances of the flight, the simulator's time should match
  the time of the flight according to the schedule. Therefore you are
  expected to set the simulator's time properly. It is recommended to
  set it to about 15 minutes before the departure at this stage so
  that you have enough time to set up your flight.
  </p>

  <p>
  When you have set the time of the simulator properly, press
  the <b>Next</b> button.
  </p>

  <h4><a name="fuelPage">The <i>Fuel</i> Page</a></h4>

  <img src="fuel.png" alt="The Fuel page"/>

  <p>
  This page contains a graphical representation of the fuel tanks of
  your aircraft. The yellowish colour represents the current level of
  the fuel in the tank, and turquoise slider is the expected level,
  which is also displayed numerically (in kilograms) below each graph.
  </p>

  <p>
  You can enter the requested amount of fuel numerically, or you can
  set it by the turquoise sliders, though this method is less accurate. The
  lever can be moved by clicking withinin the fuel tank's representation,
  and you can drag it if you keep the button pressed. If your mouse
  has a wheel, that can also be used to modify the expected level. To
  use the wheel, keep the mouse pointer within the fuel tank's
  graphic. Each click of the wheel increment or decrements the amount
  by 10 kilograms. If you hold down the <b>Shift</b> key, the
  increment will be 100, if you hold down the <b>Ctrl</b> key, the
  increment will be 1.
  </p>

  <p>
  When all tanks have the correct amount of fuel set, press
  the <b>Next</b> button. This causes the pumping of the fuel to
  start. The progress is represented by the yellowish fuel bars
  growing or shrinking (fuel may be pumped out of a tank as
  well). This is a relatively quick process and should finish within a
  few seconds.
  </p>

  <h4><a name="routePage">The <i>Route</i> Page</a></h4>

  <img src="route.png" alt="The Route page"/>

  <p>
  This page displays the cruise level and the flight plan route. The
  cruise level starts out at FL240, but the route comes from the
  booked flight. Set the cruise level to the one you have calculated
  with, and modify the flight plan if needed. For example, if you will
  enter some airspace that will require you to change the flight
  level, you should add that here.
  </p>

  <p>
  When satisfied with the information on the page, press
  the <b>Next</b> button to advance. Note, that these data can be
  edited later as well if you come back to this page.
  </p>

  <h4><a name="briefingPage">The <i>Briefing</i> Pages</a></h4>

  <img src="briefing.png" alt="The Briefing page"/>

  <p>
  These pages display the NOTAMs and the METAR for the departure and
  the arrival airports. You can edit the METAR if your network
  provides a different weather, or you do not fly with real
  weather. The METAR of the arrival airport will be updated when
  entering the landing stage, unless you have edited it before. The
  METARs can be edited during the whole duration of the flight. If you
  do so, please, comment on it in the <i>Comments</i> section of
  the <a href="#flightInfoTab"><i>Flight info</i> tab</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
  On the second briefing page (that of the arrival airport), confirm
  that you have read the briefing and are ready to start the flight by
  clicking the button. This begins the monitoring of your flight with
  the boarding stage.
  </p>

  <h4><a name="takeoffPage">The <i>Takeoff</i> Page</a></h4>

  <img src="takeoff.png" alt="The Takeoff page"/><!-- TODO: update -->

  <p>
  On this page you have to enter the name of the departure runway, the
  name of the Standard Instrument Departure procedure you follow after
  takeoff and the takeoff V-speeds. While you can edit these data
  anytime, it is recommended to do so before takeoff.
  <p>

  <p>
  Note that if you are flying one of the Tupolev or Yak aircraft, the
  page will look different, as speeds will have to be entered in
  kilometres per hour.
  </p>

  <p>
  For most aircraft in the fleet you should also enter the takeoff
  derate setting. Its exact format and value depends on the type.
  </p>

  <p>
  You can also select here whether you have turned on any anti-ice
  systems (apart from the pitot heat). However, for most aircraft, the
  logger can detect the setting, and if anti-icing is turned on, the
  check box will be checked automatically. If you have checked it
  yourself, it will not be unchecked by the program (unless it gains
  self-awareness sometime in the future).
  </p>

  <p>
  You can proceed to the next page after takeoff, and if all data has
  been entered, by pressing the <b>Next</b> button.
  </p>

  <h4><a name="cruisePage">The <i>Cruise</i> Page</a></h4>

  <img src="cruise.png" alt="The Cruise page"/><!-- TODO: create -->

  <p>
  This page displays your cruise altitude as set on the
  <a href="#routePage">Route page</a>. If you need to modify your
  cruise level due to airspace requirements, step climb or any other
  justified reason, you can set the new level here and then press
  the <b>Update</b> button when you have reached the specified level.
  </p>

  <p>
  If you are preparing for landing, you can press the <b>Next</b>
  button to go to the next page.
  </p>

  <h4><a name="landingPage">The <i>Landing</i> Page</a></h4>

  <img src="landing.png" alt="The Landing page"/><!-- TODO: update -->

  <p>
  On this page you have to enter the name of the STAR and/or
  transition you planned to follow (even if you get a different one,
  or simply vectors from ATC, in which case add a
  <a href="#flightInfoTab">comment</a> about it),
  the approach type (e.g. <q>ILS</q>, <q>VOR</q>, <q>VISUAL</q>,
  etc.), the name of the landing runway, and the landing reference speed,
  V<sub>ref</sub>. You can enter this data during the flight, or after
  you have landed, at your discretion. Note, that if you fly one of
  the Tupolev or Yak aircraft, the speed will have to be entered in km/h.
  </p>

  <p>
  This page also contains a checkbox for the anti-ice system, which is
  handled the same way as the one on
  the <a href="#takeoffPage">Takeoff page</a>.

  <p>
  When you have entered all data, press the <b>Next</b> button. It is
  active only, if the flight has ended.
  </p>

  <h4><a name="finishPage">The <i>Finish</i> Page</a></h4>

  <img src="finish.png" alt="The Finish page"/>

  <p>
  This is the final page of the flight wizard. It contains a summary
  of your flight: the rating, the flight and block times, the distance
  flown and the amount of fuel burnt.
  </p>

  <p>
  You also have to provide a few pieces of information. You have to
  select the type of the flight from the list provided (scheduled,
  old-timer, VIP, charter) and whether it was an online flight or
  not. If you arrive at the Budapest Ferihegy Airport, and are using
  the Online Gate System, you also need to specify the number of the
  gate or stand you have parked you aircraft at.
  </p>

  <p>
  If all necessary data has been entered, and the program is so
  <a href="#prefsGeneral">configured<a>, it will automatically save
  the PIREP.
  </p>

  <p>
  With all data entered, you may want it review your flight (i.e. the
  earlier pages or some of the other tabs), then save or send the
  PIREP created from it. These can be accomplished by pressing one of
  the buttons at the bottom. A saved PIREP can be loaded later and
  sent, if the sending fails for some reason. When a PIREP is sent, it
  becomes available for review by the designated PIREP reviewers of
  Malév Virtual.
  </p>

  <p>
  You can also start a new flight using the <b>New flight</b>
  button. If you have not saved or sent the PIREP, you will be asked
  to confirm your intention. When starting a new flight you are taken
  to the <a href="#flightSelectionPage">flight selection page</a>, if
  you have logged in to the MAVA server, or to
  the <a href="#loginPage">login page</a>, if your flight has been an
  offline flight.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="flightInfoTab">The Flight info Tab</a></h3>

  <img src="flightInfoTab.png" alt="The Flight info tab"/>

  <p>
  This tab allows one to enter some additional information about the
  flight, if necessary.
  </p>

  <p>
  The <i>Comments</i> text area should contain any general information
  that you would like the PIREP reviewer to know about. For example,
  why you changed the METAR, why you lowered the gears accidentally
  (i.e. pressed the wrong key on the keyboard), etc.
  </p>

  <p>
  The <i>Flight defects</i> text area should contain information about
  any problems you encountered with the plane during the flight. For
  example an engine stopped and why (if known), that flaps could not
  be extended or retracted, etc.
  </p>

  <p>
  In the <i>Delay codes</i> area you can mark one or more reasons why
  the flight was delayed, if it was. The options are self-explanatory.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="helpTab">The Help Tab</a></h3>

  <img src="helpTab.png" alt="The Help tab"/>

  <p>
  This tab provides some help for calculating and setting the payload
  weight of the aircraft. It can be used once the
  <a href="#payloadPage"><i>Payload</i></a>
  (i.e. the cargo weight) is finalized. To use this tab, check
  the <b>Using help</b> checkbox. It causes the page to become
  sensitive and filled with data. Note, that the fact of using the
  help is <a href="#logTab">logged</a>, so the PIREP reviewers will
  know about it.
  </p>

  <p>
  The most important information is after the <i>Payload:</i> label,
  which is the payload weight of the aircraft. This value should be
  set in the simulator as the airplane's payload weight. By pressing
  the <b>Simulator data</b> button, the data coming from the simulator
  can be queried and displayed. If the data is out of the tolerances,
  it is displayed in red, otherwise in green.
  </p>

  <p>
  The gross weight is also displayed with some maximum weights of the
  aircraft, so it can be checked or estimated if you will remain within
  those maximums during the flight.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="logTab">The Log Tab</a></h3>

  <img src="logTab.png" alt="The Log tab"/>

  <p>
  This is the main log of your flight that will be analyzed by the
  PIREP reviewers. Its contents is generated automatically by the
  program, and most lines are prefixed by the simulator times the
  information in the given line belongs to.
  </p>

  <p>
  While the log's contents is mainly useful for PIREP reviewers, it
  can come handy when things start to happen very fast, and you have
  no time check each fault message passing by (if you have enabled
  such messages at all). Later, when things calm down, you can check
  the log to see what happened exactly, so that you know why so many
  fault points have been awarded. For example, you may even decide to
  abort the flight, if you think some of the faults are too
  embarrassing :) For quick identification, the lines containing the
  fault messages are highlighted.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="gatesTab">The Gates Tab</a></h3>

  <img src="gatesTab.png" alt="The Gates tab"/>

  <p>
  This tab displays information retrieved from
  the MAVA <a href="#onlineGateSystem">Online Gate System</a>.
  If the program needs to retrieve data, this tab's contents
  are refreshed automatically, but you can also refresh them manually
  anytime using the <b>Refresh data</b> button.
  </p>

  <p>
  The left side of the tab contains the fleet information. The tail
  number of each aircraft is listed with the plane's status, as known
  by the Online Gate System. The two major statuses are <i>LHBP-nn</i>
  and <i>AWAY</i>. The former indicates that the aircraft is parked at
  the Budapest Ferihegy Airport at gate or stand <i>nn</i>, while the
  latter one denotes that the airplane is parked at another
  airport. Another possible status is <i>PARKED</i>, which means that
  the airplane is parked somewhere at the Ferihegy Airport, but we
  (or at least the Gate System) don't know where. It may happen that
  several aircraft are parked at the same gate or stand at
  Ferihegy. In this case the tail numbers and the statuses of those
  airplanes are displayed in red.
  </p>

  <p>
  The right side contains the list of the numbers of the gates and
  parking positions. A number is black if no aircraft is positioned at
  the corresponding gate or stand, and it is orange, if the location
  is occupied.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="debugLog">The Debug log</a></h3>

  <img src="debugLogTab.png" alt="The Debug log tab"/>

  <p>
  This tab is not visible by default, but can be displayed by
  selecting <b>View/Show debug log</b> or by
  pressing <b>Ctrl+D</b>. It is another kind of log, which is mainly
  useful for debugging. If you experience some problem with the
  program, please, include the contents of this log with your bug
  report. It can help a lot with finding a solution to the problem.
  </p>

  <h2><a name="loadingPIREPs">Loading PIREPs</a></h2>

  <p>
  Saved PIREPs can be loaded and sent by the program. This can
  become necessary, for example, if you cannot send a PIREP due to
  some network problem right after your flight, or when you
  deliberately performed a flight without connecting to the Internet.
  </p>

  <p>
  To load a PIREP select the <b>File/Load PIREP...</b> menu option or
  press the <b>Ctrl+L</b> key. A file selection dialog appears, from
  which you can select the PIREP to load. If you select a valid PIREP
  file, it will be loaded and a new window will be displayed with the
  most important data of your flight. By clicking <b>Send
  PIREP...</b>, the PIREP will be sent (or at least an attempt will be
  made at sending it). A dialog window will be displayed about the
  results of the attempt.
  </p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="pirepLoaded.png" alt="The loaded PIREP window"/>
  </div>

  <p>
  You may also want to view a saved PIREP, for example, if it is a
  PIREP about an entrance exam flight. To do so, click the <b>View
  PIREP...</b> button. This displays the PIREP viewer window, which
  groups the data into three tabs. The <i>Data</i> tab contains the
  itemized data of the flight. The <i>Comments & defects</i> tab
  displays the comments and or flight defects entered by the
  user. The <i>Log</i> tab contains the flight log.
  </p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="pirepViewer.png" alt="The PIREP Viewer"/>
  </div>

  <h2><a name="checklistEditor">Editing checklists</a></h2>

  <img src="checklistEditor.png" alt="The Checklist Editor"/>

  <p>
  The checklists are lists of audio files. When checklist playback is
  enabled (see the <a href="#prefsSounds">description</a> of
  the <i>Preferences</i> window below), and there is a checklist for
  the type of the aircraft used for the flight, the files constituting
  the checklist can be played one-by-one by pressing the checklist
  hotkey repeatedly.
  </p>

  <p>
  The checklist editor window allows for editing the checklists. It
  can be displayed by selecting <b>Tools/Checklist Editor...</b> or
  pressing <b>Ctrl+C</b>. The top of the window contains an aircraft
  type selector.
  </p>

  <p>
  The files making up the checklist for the currently selected aircraft
  are displayed on the right. You can move a file up or down by
  dragging it with the mouse. You can also select one or more files
  from the list. Then you can remove them with the <b>Remove</b>
  button, or move them up or down by pressing <b>Move up</b>
  and <b>Move down</b>.
  </p>

  <p>
  To add new files to the checklist, select them in the file selector
  on the left, and press <b>Add to checklist</b>. The file(s) will be
  appended to the end of the checklist.
  </p>

  <p>
  Note, that any changes you make are effective only if you press
  the <b>OK</b> button when having finished the modifications. If the
  flight has already started, no changes made to the corresponding
  checklist have any effect during the flight (i.e. you will still use
  the old checklist, or no checklist if there was none).
  </p>

  <h2><a name="calloutsEditor">Editing approach callouts</a></h2>

  <img src="calloutsEditor.png" alt="The Approach callouts Editor"/>

  <p>
  The approach callouts are audio files specific to aircraft types, that are
  played back during approach when passing certain altitudes. The
  approach callouts editor window allows editing the list of these
  callout files for each aircraft. The window can be displayed by
  selecting  <b>Tools/Approach Callouts Editor...</b> or by  pressing
  <b>Ctrl+E</b>.
  </p>

  <p>
  The top part of the window displays the selector of the aircraft
  type. Below it, you can find two buttons on the left, and the list
  of the callouts with the altitudes they belong to on the right. The
  list displays only the filename portion, but the if you hover the
  cursor above an item, the full path will be displayed. The list is
  always sorted according to the altitude, but you change the order
  from descending to ascending.
  </p>

  <p>
  The <b>Add new callout</b> button shows a file selection dialog
  window. After selecting a file, it will be added to a list with some
  altitude, which can be edited immediately. If the name of the file
  contains a number that is possible as an altitude, that will be used
  as the altitude given to the file, otherwise some meaningful default
  is selected based on the lowest or highest altitude.
  There can be no two files with the same altitude. If you set an
  altitude, which is already present in the list, a dialog box will be
  displayed, and you can choose to replace the old file or to continue
  editing. To edit an altitude already in the list, select that row,
  and click on the altitude again.
  </p>

  <p>
  If you select one or more items in the list, the <b>Remove</b>
  button becomes available, and pressing it will remove the selected items.
  </p>

  <p>
  Note, that any changes you make are effective only if you press
  the <b>OK</b> button when having finished the modifications. If the
  flight has already started, no changes made to the corresponding
  list of callouts have any effect during the flight.
  </p>

  <h2><a name="prefs">The Preferences Window</a></h2>

  </p>
  The Preferences window can be displayed by
  selecting <b>Tools/Preferences</b> or by
  pressing <b>Ctrl+P</b>. Here you can set options that you usually
  don't have to change for every flight. This window consists of
  tabs grouping the options logically.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="prefsGeneral">The <i>General</i> Tab<a></h3>

  <img src="prefsGeneral.png" alt="The General Tab of Preferences"/><!-- TODO: update -->

  <p>
  These are some general settings for various parts of the
  program. The <i>GUI</i> frame contains options regarding the
  behaviour of the graphical user interface. The <i>Language</i> combo
  box can be used to selected what language the program should
  use. Currently English and Hungarian are supported. The value
  of <i>system default</i> means that the operating system's default
  language is used if it is one of the supported ones or English
  otherwise. Note, that the program must be restarted for the change
  to take effect if you modify this setting. If the <b>Hide main window
  when minimized</b> checkbox is checked, and you minimize the window,
  it will actually disappear completely (i.e. not appear among the
  other minimized windows). You can make it appear by using the tray
  icon. If the <b>Quit when the window close button is clicked</b>
  checkbox is checked, the program will quit, after you have confirmed
  it. Otherwise it will just disappear, and you can use the tray icon
  to display it again.
  </p>

  <p>
  The <i>MAVA Online Systems</i> frame contains settings related to
  the online systems of MAVA, the <a href="#onlineGateSystem">gate</a>
  and the <a href="#onlineACARSSystem">ACARS</a> systems mentioned
  above. It is recommended to enable these for normal operations.
  </p>

  <p>
  The <i>Simulator</i> frame contains settings for how the program
  interacts with the simulator. Most options are self-explanatory, but
  the ones related to smoothing requires some discussion. Flight
  Simulator is known to produce wind speed changes that are not
  entirely realistic and can result in the simulated aircraft
  experiencing some very high indicated airspeeds, which in turn can
  also cause the autopilot to suddenly increase the climb rate to
  counter the high speeds or other erratic behaviour. Since these
  phenomena are difficult to protect oneself against without buying
  extra products, like FSUIPC, the logger provides the possibility to
  average the IAS and/or the VS over a few seconds so that spikes in
  these values are smoothed. The <b>Enable the smoothing of IAS/VS
  over N sec.</b> options allow controlling this feature. The number
  of seconds may need experimenting with, but note that every change
  for which you press the <b>OK</b> button is taken into account
  immediately.
  </p>

  <p>
  If the <b>Save PIREP automatically</b> check box is checked, and you
  have finished your flight and entered all required data, the PIREP
  will be saved automatically into the directory given above.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="prefsMessages">The <i>Messages</i> Tab</a></h3>

  <img src="prefsMessages.png" alt="The Messages Tab of Preferences"/><!-- TODO: update -->

  <p>
  The program can display messages about certain events in the
  simulator and/or it can play a warning sound when those events
  occur. The tab allows configuring this.
  <p>

  <p>
  The categories of the message are listed on the left. These are the
  following:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Logger Error Messages</b>: error messages about the
    internal working of the logger.</li>
    <li><b>Information Messages</b>: informational messages about,
    e.g., the flight stage, the end of an audio checklist, etc.</li>
    <li><b>In-flight Stage Message</b>: messages about the flight stage for those stage when the plane is not on the ground</li>
    <li><b>Fault Messages</b>: messages about the non-NO GO faults the program detects.</li>
    <li><b>NO GO Fault Messages</b>: messages about the NO GO faults the program detects</li>
    <li><b>Gate System Messages</b>: messages related to the
    <a href="#onlineGateSystem">Online Gate System</a>. For example,
    when you have landed at Ferihegy, it can display the list of the
    available gates so that you can choose where to park, if there is
    no ATC available.</li>
    <li><b>Environment Messages</b>: other messages, e.g. the welcome
    message when the flight has ended.</li>
    <li><b>Help Messages</b>: help messages, e.g. warning about
    entering the V-speeds into the Takeoff page before takeoff.</li>
    <li><b>Visibility Messages</b>: messages about the visibility
    during descent and landing.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  There are two checkboxes associated with each messages category. If the
  left one (<i>Displayed in FS</i>) is checked, the messages of the
  category will be displayed in the simulator. If the right one
  (<i>Sound alert</i>) is checked, and a message of the given category
  is about to be displayed, a warning sound will be played. It is
  mainly intended to accompany the text messages, but the two options
  can be controlled separately, so you can select the sound alert, but
  not the displaying of the messages. This may be useful if you don't
  want these messages to clutter up the windscreen of your aircraft,
  but still get some notification that some problem occurred.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="prefsSounds">The <i>Sounds</i> Tab</a></h3>

  <img src="prefsSounds.png" alt="The Sounds Tab of Preferences"/>

  <p>
  This tab controls how the sounds are played by the application.
  </p>

  <p>
  The top part is for the background sounds. These are pre-recorded
  sound files that are played when certain conditions hold during the
  flight. Typical examples are the various announcements the flight
  attendants make during the flight. The <b>Enable background
  sounds</b> checkbox controls whether such sounds are enabled at
  all. If the <b>Pilot controls sounds</b> checkbox is enabled, the
  pilot should start the playback of these sound files by pressing a
  hotkey in the simulator. Note, that you should still be in the right
  flight stage (and sometimes fulfill other conditions) to be able to
  play the sound files. Also, one file can be played only once. If you
  enable this option, the hotkey to press in the simulator can be
  selected below. You can choose one of the alphanumeric keys (0-9,
  A-Z) optionally combined with one or both of the <i>Ctrl</i>
  and <i>Shift</i> modifiers. If this checkbox is not checked, the
  sound files will be played automatically.
  </p>

  <p>
  If the <b>Enable approach callouts</b> checkbox is
  checked, and you have also <a href="#calloutsEditor">set up</a>
  approach callouts for the aircraft being used, you will hear those
  callouts during approach.
  </p>

  <p>
  If the <b>Enable speedbrake sound at touchdown</b> checkbox is
  checked, you will hear a distinctive sound when the spoilers deploy
  automatically after touchdown.
  </p>

  <p>
  The lower part, named <i>Checklists</i> contains some settings
  related to the audio checklists belonging to the aircraft. They are
  available only if the <b>Enable aircraft-specific checklist</b>
  checkbox is selected. In this case another hotkey should be
  specified. If you press this hotkey, the next file from the
  checklist will be played.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="prefsAdvanced">The <i>Advanced</i> Tab</a></h3>

  <img src="prefsAdvanced.png" alt="The Advanced Tab of Preferences"/>

  <p>
  This tab contains some settings that you normally should not
  change. Currently, these settings are related to the automatic
  update. If the <b>Update the program automatically</b> checkbox is
  not checked, the automatic update at program start-up will be
  omitted. The <i>Update URL</i> text entry field contains the URL
  from which to download the updates. Occasionally the developers of
  the application may tell you to change this something else, e.g. to
  test some development version. Or it may need to be changed due to
  organizational reasons, such as moving to a new server, etc.
  </p>

  <h2><a name="monitorWindow">The Monitor Window</a></h2>

  <img src="monitorWindow.png" alt="The Monitor Window"/><!-- TODO: update -->

  <p>
  The monitor window can be used when debugging the program. You can
  display it by selecting <b>View/Show monitor window</b> or by
  pressing <b>Ctrl+M</b>. It displays the various parameters from the
  aircraft as read from the flight simulator. During flight, it is
  updated once per second. If something is not detected properly by
  the logger, this window can be used to determine if the problem is
  in interpreting and translating the data read from the simulator, or
  when the translated data is being evaluated by other parts of the
  program.
